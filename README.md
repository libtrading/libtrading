# Libtrading

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/penberg/libtrading.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/penberg/libtrading)

Libtrading is an open source C library for high-speed, low latency electronic
trading. It aims to support market data and market access to exchanges around
the world and lower the barrier of entry to trading.

The library is designed for high performance and robustness. Although latency
is crucial in trading today's markets, reliability is also a top priority.
